This directory is for building the jEdit installers.  Run the script buildinstallers.sh on Mac/Linux and the script will:

1.  download the source for jEdit 5.1.1
2.  copy over new versions of ld and windres (needed for Mac)
3.  copy the AithonLibrary from the git repository
4.  build the installers

You will find the installers in the 'dist' directory.

Building the Windows installer:

1.  Copy jedit5.1.1-dist-win-finish.tar.bz2 to a Windows machine
2.  Replace build.properties
3.  Replace win32installer.iss in package-files/windows
