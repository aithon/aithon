This directory is for building the jEdit installers.  

1.  Build the plugin in aithon_plugin

      -Rename the appropriate build.properties file
      -run 'ant dist'
      -make a 'jars' directory in the aithon_plugin directory and
       copy the Aithon.jar file into the 'jars' directory

2.  Run the script buildinstallers.sh on Mac/Linux and the script will:

      -download the source for jEdit 5.1.1
      -copy over new versions of ld and windres (needed for Mac)
      -copy the AithonLibrary from the git repository
      -build the installers

You will find the installers in the 'jedit_temp/dist' directory.
