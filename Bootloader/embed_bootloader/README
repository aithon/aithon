To generate an application with an embedded bootloader image:

1.  build the bootloader (the image will be in Bootloader/build/ch.bin)
2.  run the embed.py script as:

  embed.py ../build/ch.bin > embed_bootloader.h

3.  build the user application by running 'make' in the embed_bootloader directory
4.  flash the user application in Bootloader/embed_bootloader/build/ch.bin
5.  the application will run and prompt to press Button0
6.  the message 'Success' should appear 
7.  flash a any new user application to erase the bootloader update image
