This directory is for building the jEdit installers.  Run the script run.sh on a Mac and the script will:

1.  download the source for jEdit 5.1.1
2.  copy over new versions of ld and windres
3.  copy the AithonLibrary from the git repository
4.  build the installers

You will find the installers in the 'dist' directory.
